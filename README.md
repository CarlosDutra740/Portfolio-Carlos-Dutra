# About Me

I am an electrical engineer with a strong focus on electrical systems, automation, and networks. My career is driven by the pursuit of solutions that blend technical robustness with forward-thinking, connecting classical engineering with emerging technologies. With every project, I aim to transform complexity into clear, scalable, and intelligent systems.

My engineering background extends into Python programming applied to data analysis and machine learning, bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. I develop predictive models, smart automations, and decision support tools that enhance industrial and energy processes. Programming logic has become an extension of engineering, enabling simulations, diagnostics, and optimizations at scale.

I see technology as an architecture of possibilities: energy, data, and automation integrated into a unified vision of advanced systems. I draw inspiration from cutting-edge engineering concepts—from smart grids to AI applications—to build solutions that not only solve problems but also set new standards for efficiency. This is the space where I aim to operate, at the intersection of reality and potential.

This portfolio serves as a showcase of my most relevant projects, technical skills, and professional journey. My goal is to demonstrate what I have accomplished and how I can add value to future projects—whether in employment, as a freelancer, or through partnerships.
